|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Data Wrangling, I<br><br>Perform the following operations using Python on any open source dataset (e.g., data.csv)<br><br>1. Import all the required Python Libraries.<br><br>2. Locate an open source data from the web (e.g., https://www.kaggle.com). Provide a clear<br><br>description of the data and its source (i.e., URL of the web site).<br><br>3. Load the Dataset into pandas dataframe.<br><br>4. Data Preprocessing: check for missing values in the data using pandas isnull(), describe()<br><br>function to get some initial statistics. Provide variable descriptions. Types of variables etc.<br><br>Check the dimensions of the data frame.<br><br>5. Data Formatting and Data Normalization: Summarize the types of variables by checking<br><br>the data types (i.e., character, numeric, integer, factor, and logical) of the variables in the<br><br>data set. If variables are not in the correct data type, apply proper type conversions.<br><br>6. Turn categorical variables into quantitative variables in Python.<br><br>In addition to the codes and outputs, explain every operation that you do in the above steps and<br><br>explain everything that you do to import/read/scrape the data set. | [Group-A/Q1.ipynb](Group-A/Q1.ipynb) | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUBNf72wRGY&list=PLlShVH4JA0otdEk1LKPX_H6Cp5CblDq91&index=1&pp=iAQB |
| 2 | Data Wrangling II<br><br>Create an “Academic performance” dataset of students and perform the following operations using<br><br>Python.<br><br>1. Scan all variables for missing values and inconsistencies. If there are missing values and/or<br><br>inconsistencies, use any of the suitable techniques to deal with them.<br><br>2. Scan all numeric variables for outliers. If there are outliers, use any of the suitable<br><br>techniques to deal with them.<br><br>3. Apply data transformations on at least one of the variables. The purpose of this<br><br>transformation should be one of the following reasons: to change the scale for better<br><br>understanding of the variable, to convert a non-linear relation into a linear one, or to<br><br>decrease the skewness and convert the distribution into a normal distribution.<br><br>Reason and document your approach properly. | [Group-A/Q2.ipynb](Group-A/Q2.ipynb) | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTKyBDfDlaA&list=PLlShVH4JA0otdEk1LKPX_H6Cp5CblDq91&index=2&pp=iAQB |
| 3 | Descriptive Statistics - Measures of Central Tendency and variability<br><br>Perform the following operations on any open source dataset (e.g., data.csv)<br><br>1. Provide summary statistics (mean, median, minimum, maximum, standard deviation) for<br><br>a dataset (age, income etc.) with numeric variables grouped by one of the qualitative<br><br>(categorical) variable. For example, if your categorical variable is age groups and<br><br>quantitative variable is income, then provide summary statistics of income grouped by the<br><br>age groups. Create a list that contains a numeric value for each response to the categorical<br><br>variable.<br><br>2. Write a Python program to display some basic statistical details like percentile, mean,<br><br>standard deviation etc. of the species of ‘Iris-setosa’, ‘Iris-versicolor’ and ‘Iris-versicolor’<br><br>of iris.csv dataset.<br><br>Provide the codes with outputs and explain everything that you do in this step. | [Group-A/Q3.ipynb](Group-A/Q3.ipynb) | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtahGMHpqCo&list=PLlShVH4JA0otdEk1LKPX_H6Cp5CblDq91&index=3&pp=iAQB |
| 4 | Data Analytics I<br><br>Create a Linear Regression Model using Python/R to predict home prices using Boston Housing<br><br>Dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/c/boston-housing). The Boston Housing dataset contains<br><br>information about various houses in Boston through different parameters. There are 506 samples<br><br>and 14 feature variables in this dataset.<br><br>The objective is to predict the value of prices of the house using the given features. | [Group-A/Q4.ipynb](Group-A/Q4.ipynb) | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w34Ib9DUDr4&list=PLlShVH4JA0otdEk1LKPX_H6Cp5CblDq91&index=4&pp=iAQB |
| 5 | Data Analytics II<br><br>1. Implement logistic regression using Python/R to perform classification on<br><br>Social_Network_Ads.csv dataset.<br><br>2. Compute Confusion matrix to find TP, FP, TN, FN, Accuracy, Error rate, Precision, Recall<br><br>on the given dataset. | [Group-A/Q5.ipynb](Group-A/Q5.ipynb) | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K7VIS6LZgI&list=PLlShVH4JA0otdEk1LKPX_H6Cp5CblDq91&index=5&pp=iAQB |
| 6 | Data Analytics III<br><br>1. Implement Simple Naïve Bayes classification algorithm using Python/R on iris.csv dataset.<br><br>2. Compute Confusion matrix to find TP, FP, TN, FN, Accuracy, Error rate, Precision, Recall<br><br>on the given dataset. |  |  |
| 7 | Text Analytics<br><br>1. Extract Sample document and apply following document preprocessing methods:<br><br>Tokenization, POS Tagging, stop words removal, Stemming and Lemmatization.<br><br>2. Create representation of document by calculating Term Frequency and Inverse Document<br><br>Frequency. |  |  |
| 8 | Data Visualization I<br><br>1. Use the inbuilt dataset 'titanic'. The dataset contains 891 rows and contains information<br><br>about the passengers who boarded the unfortunate Titanic ship. Use the Seaborn library to<br><br>see if we can find any patterns in the data.<br><br>2. Write a code to check how the price of the ticket (column name: 'fare') for each passenger<br><br>is distributed by plotting a histogram. |  |  |
| 9 | Data Visualization II<br><br>1. Use the inbuilt dataset 'titanic' as used in the above problem. Plot a box plot for distribution<br><br>of age with respect to each gender along with the information about whether they survived<br><br>or not. (Column names : 'sex' and 'age')<br><br>2. Write observations on the inference from the above statistics. |  |  |
| 10 | Data Visualization III<br><br>Download the Iris flower dataset or any other dataset into a DataFrame. (e.g.,<br><br>https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris ). Scan the dataset and give the inference as:<br><br>1. List down the features and their types (e.g., numeric, nominal) available in the dataset.<br><br>2. Create a histogram for each feature in the dataset to illustrate the feature distributions.<br><br>3. Create a boxplot for each feature in the dataset.<br><br>4. Compare distributions and identify outliers. |  |  |
